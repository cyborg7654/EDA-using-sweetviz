what is sweetviz?
It is a library that provides essential facts about your dataset without having you to write much code.
With just two lines of code, the open-source Python library Sweetviz creates stunning, high-density graphics to jumpstart exploratory data analysis (EDA). A totally independent HTML application is produced.

The system was created to compare datasets and instantly visualise target values. Its purpose is to make jobs like fast analysis of target features, training vs. testing data, and other data characterisation tasks possible.
